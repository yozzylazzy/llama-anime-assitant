# Character Selection Interface

This project provides an interactive character selection interface, allowing users to choose from a variety of preloaded 2D character models. The models are rendered using **Pixi.js** and **Live2D**, offering high-quality rendering for each character.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Character Rendering**: Select a character, and the model will be displayed in the center of the screen.
- **Responsive Design**: The canvas automatically adjusts to the screen size, ensuring a smooth experience on all devices.
- **Model Scaling**: The character models are scaled dynamically to fit the screen size, maintaining high-quality visuals.
- **Interactive Selection**: Users can switch between different characters easily with a click.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Pixi.js**: A fast 2D WebGL renderer to display and animate the Live2D models.
- **Live2D**: A technology that allows 2D models to move and react, providing a more lifelike experience.
- **React**: For building the user interface and handling state.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling and ensuring a responsive layout.
