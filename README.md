# PIXIE-PAL ASSISTANT
**Your smart assistant**, available locally or through the PixiePal Assistant website. In this era of rapid technological advancement, especially in Artificial Intelligence (AI), we are not being replaced but empowered with tools **to enhance our productivity and creativity**.

Having **a personal assistant**, particularly for coding, **can be costly**. Humans are not machinesâ€”we can't remember every syntax or nuance of programming languages (trust me, it's exhausting! ðŸ˜‚). **With the power of AI**, especially advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) ,**we can get fast, accurate responses without spending excessive time searching for answers**.

**PixiePal Assistant** is designed to be a cute and visually delightful AI companion that doesn't just provide functionality but also adds a touch of joy and personality to your daily interactions

## Planned Features

- **Customizable AI Character Assistants:** Select from a variety of characters with unique personalities, voices, and speaking styles.
- **Pleasant and Minimalist Design:** A simple yet visually comforting color palette for a seamless user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully accessible on both mobile and desktop platforms.
- **Robust Language Models:** Leveraging Ollama for local deployment and OpenAI for the hosted version to provide a powerful conversational AI experience.
- **Fast Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Integrates Edge-TTS for quick and natural voice synthesis.
- **Adorable Character Animations:** Utilizes Live2D Cubism models to bring cute, engaging characters to life.

## Character Selection Interface

This project provides an interactive character selection interface, allowing users to choose from a variety of **preloaded 2D character models**. The models are rendered using **Pixi.js** and **Live2D**, delivering high-quality visuals and smooth animations for an immersive experience.

### Features

- **Dynamic Character Rendering**: Select a character, and the model is dynamically displayed in the center of the screen.
- R**esponsive Design**: The canvas automatically adjusts to the screen size, ensuring a seamless experience on any device.
- **Model Scaling**: Characters are dynamically scaled to fit the screen while maintaining high visual fidelity.
- **Interactive Selection**: Users can easily switch between different characters with just a click.

## Technologies Used

- **Pixi.js**: A fast 2D WebGL renderer to display and animate Live2D models.
- **Live2D**: Enables 2D models to move and react, creating a lifelike experience.
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **TailwindCSS**: Provides responsive styling and clean layouts.
- **Vite**: A fast development environment for modern web projects.
- **Ollama**: For deploying LLMs locally.
- **OpenAI**: For hosted AI capabilities.
- **Edge-TTS**: Facilitates fast and natural text-to-speech synthesis.
- **Express**: Backend framework for API handling.
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment.

## Acknowledgments
This project, **PixiePal Assistant**, would not have been possible without the open-source libraries, tutorials, and tools that supported its development. I **extend my heartfelt thanks to the incredible developer community for their contributions and knowledge sharing**.

Please note that **PixiePal Assistant is not intended for commercial use due to asset licensing agreements**. However, it is free to use for anyone looking for an adorable and functional smart AI assistant.

## Motivational Note

>***Great ideas donâ€™t come with perfect timing**â€”they arise from curiosity and the persistence to bring them to life. **Through hard work**, countless iterations, and leveraging the power of the open-source community, **PixiePal Assistant has transformed from a simple concept to a reality**. Let this project inspire you to believe in your creativity, no matter how limited your time or resources may seem.*
